### Why do they have same IP Adress Spaces In Each House?
We have a flat network. We Implemented the Basic IP Schema for both houses because it was a flat network. Ideally you would not have overlapping networks

### Why not wired connection?
We used a wirless bridge because it was winter and we could not trench frozen ground. Ideally we run a wired line.
